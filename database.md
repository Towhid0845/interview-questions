## What is self join. Write an example?
A self join is a type of join in SQL that allows you to combine and compare rows within the same table. It is useful when you need to relate records in a table to other records in the same table. This is typically done using table aliases to differentiate between the two instances of the table.

```database
SELECT   
    e1.name AS Employee,  
    e2.name AS Manager  
FROM   
    employees e1  
LEFT JOIN   
    employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id; 
```

## What is database transections and how to make it more efficient?
A database transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. A transaction must satisfy four key properties, often referred to as ACID properties:

1. **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations within the transaction are completed successfully. If any operation fails, the entire transaction is aborted, and the database state is unchanged.

2. **Consistency**: Guarantees that a transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all predefined rules, including constraints and triggers.

3. **Isolation**: Ensures that transactions are executed in isolation from one another. The intermediate state of a transaction is not visible to other transactions until it is committed.

4. **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even in the event of a system failure.

### Making Transactions More Efficient
To enhance the efficiency of database transactions, consider the following strategies:

1. **Minimize Transaction Scope**: Keep transactions as short as possible. This reduces the time locks are held and minimizes contention among transactions.

2. **Batch Processing**: Group multiple operations into a single transaction when possible. This reduces the overhead of transaction management and can improve performance.

3. **Use Appropriate Isolation Levels**: Choose the right isolation level based on the application requirements. Lower isolation levels (like Read Committed) can improve concurrency but may lead to phenomena like dirty reads.

4. **Optimize Queries**: Ensure that the SQL queries within transactions are optimized for performance. Use indexes, avoid unnecessary joins, and select only the required columns.

5. **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling to reduce the overhead of establishing database connections for each transaction. This can significantly improve performance in high-load scenarios.

6. **Avoid Long-Running Transactions**: Long transactions can lead to increased locking and blocking. Break them into smaller, manageable transactions if possible.

7. **Monitor and Tune Performance**: Regularly monitor transaction performance and analyze slow queries. Use database profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and optimize them.

8. **Use Stored Procedures**: Encapsulating transaction logic in stored procedures can reduce the amount of data sent over the network and improve execution speed.

## What is data redundancy and data inconsistency. How to mitigate these?
### Data Redundancy
Data redundancy refers to the unnecessary duplication of data within a database. This can occur when the same piece of data is stored in multiple places, leading to increased storage costs and potential complications in data management. 

**Causes of Data Redundancy:**
- Poor database design, such as not normalizing the database.
- Storing the same information in different tables without proper relationships.
- Lack of a centralized data management system.

### Data Inconsistency
Data inconsistency occurs when the same piece of data is stored in multiple locations and the values do not match. This can lead to confusion and errors in data retrieval and reporting.

**Causes of Data Inconsistency:**
- Data redundancy, where multiple copies of the same data exist.
- Lack of proper synchronization mechanisms when data is updated.
- Manual data entry errors or failures in data migration processes.


### Mitigating Data Redundancy and Inconsistency
To reduce data redundancy and inconsistency, consider the following strategies:

1. **Database Normalization**: Organize the database to minimize redundancy by dividing data into related tables and establishing relationships.

2. **Use of Primary Keys**: Ensure that each table has a primary key to uniquely identify records, preventing duplicate entries.

3. **Implement Constraints**: Use constraints (like unique constraints) to enforce data integrity and prevent duplicate data entries.

4. **Centralized Data Management**: Maintain a single source of truth for data to avoid duplication and ensure consistency across the system.

5. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular data audits to identify and resolve redundancy and inconsistency issues.
