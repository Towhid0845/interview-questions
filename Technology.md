✅ What is electron js?
    ➡️ Electron is a framework for building desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. By embedding
        Chromium and Node. js into its binary, Electron allows you to maintain one JavaScript codebase and create 
        cross-platform apps that work on Windows, macOS, and Linux — no native development experience is required.

✅ What is a base64 image?
    ➡️ Base64 encoding is used in a variety of contexts to encode binary data into a text format. This makes it easier to handle and transmit binary data in systems designed for textual data. Here are some common uses of Base64, including its use with images:

### Uses of Base64

1. **Embedding Images in Web Pages**:
   - **Data URLs**: Base64 is often used to embed images directly into HTML or CSS files using Data URLs. This can be useful for including small images like icons or logos, reducing the number of HTTP requests needed to load a web page.
     ```html
     <img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAU...">
     ```

2. **Email Attachments**:
   - **MIME Encoding**: Base64 is used to encode binary attachments in email messages, such as images, documents, or any other type of file. This ensures that binary data can be transmitted over text-based email protocols.
     ```mime
     Content-Type: image/png
     Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
     
     iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAU...
     ```

3. **Data Storage**:
   - **Configuration Files**: Base64 encoding is sometimes used to store binary data in text-based configuration files or scripts, allowing for easier handling and transportation of binary data.
   - **Database Fields**: Some databases use Base64 encoding to store binary data, such as images or files, within text fields.

4. **Web APIs**:
   - **JSON and XML**: When binary data needs to be included in JSON or XML responses from web APIs, Base64 encoding is used. This is common for APIs that return images or files in addition to textual data.
     ```json
     {
       "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAU..."
     }
     ```

5. **Basic Authentication**:
   - **HTTP Headers**: In HTTP Basic Authentication, Base64 encoding is used to encode the credentials (username and password) into a format that can be included in HTTP headers.
     ```http
     Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==
     ```

6. **Data Obfuscation**:
   - **Simple Encoding**: Base64 can be used to obfuscate data or configuration values in a way that makes them less readable. This is not a security measure but can be useful for preventing casual inspection.

7. **File Uploads**:
   - **Forms**: Base64 encoding is sometimes used to encode file data before sending it in web forms. This is particularly useful for simple file upload implementations where the binary data needs to be transmitted as text.

### Base64 Image Use Cases

- **Inline Images**: Embedding images directly into HTML or CSS allows for faster loading of small assets, as they are included within the HTML or CSS file itself. This can reduce the number of HTTP requests, which is beneficial for performance, particularly for small images or icons.

- **Email Signatures**: Base64-encoded images can be embedded in email signatures, allowing for rich visual content without needing external image files.

- **Data URIs**: Using Base64 encoding with Data URIs allows for the inclusion of images or other binary data directly within HTML documents or CSS stylesheets. This approach can simplify the management of resources and improve performance for small assets.

### Considerations

- **Increased Size**: Base64-encoded data is roughly 33% larger than the original binary data. This increase in size can be a drawback, particularly for larger files or images.

- **Performance Impact**: Large Base64-encoded data can impact performance, both in terms of page load times and browser rendering, due to the increased size and the need for decoding.

- **Not for Large Files**: For large files or images, it's generally better to use traditional methods of file linking or serving, rather than embedding them as Base64.

Base64 encoding is a versatile tool for handling binary data in text-based systems. Its use cases span web development, email, data storage, and more, making it an essential technique for encoding and transmitting data in a variety of applications.
