### ✅ What is electron js?
Electron is a framework for building desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. By embedding Chromium and Node. js into its binary, Electron allows you to maintain one JavaScript codebase and create cross-platform apps that work on Windows, macOS, and Linux — no native development experience is required.

### ✅ What is a base64 image?
Base64 is an encoding algorithm that converts any characters, binary data, and even images or sound files into a readable string, which can be saved or transported over the network without data loss. The characters generated from Base64 encoding consist of Latin letters(A-Z and a-z), digits(0-9), plus(+), and slash(/) in total 64 characters. That's why it called base64. Base64 decoding is also can be done using the reverse of encoding process. 

### Uses of Base64

1. **Embedding Images in Web Pages**:
   - **Data URLs**: Base64 is often used to embed images directly into HTML or CSS files using Data URLs. This can be useful for including small images like icons or logos, reducing the number of HTTP requests needed to load a web page.
     ```html
     <img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAU...">
     ```

2. **Email Attachments**:
   - **MIME Encoding**: Base64 is used to encode binary attachments in email messages, such as images, documents, or any other type of file. This ensures that binary data can be transmitted over text-based email protocols.
     ```mime
     Content-Type: image/png
     Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
     
     iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAU...
     ```

3. **Data Storage**:
   - **Configuration Files**: Base64 encoding is sometimes used to store binary data in text-based configuration files or scripts, allowing for easier handling and transportation of binary data.
   - **Database Fields**: Some databases use Base64 encoding to store binary data, such as images or files, within text fields.

4. **Web APIs**:
   - **JSON and XML**: When binary data needs to be included in JSON or XML responses from web APIs, Base64 encoding is used. This is common for APIs that return images or files in addition to textual data.
     ```json
     {
       "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAU..."
     }
     ```

5. **Basic Authentication**:
   - **HTTP Headers**: In HTTP Basic Authentication, Base64 encoding is used to encode the credentials (username and password) into a format that can be included in HTTP headers.
     ```http
     Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==
     ```

7. **File Uploads**:
   - **Forms**: Base64 encoding is sometimes used to encode file data before sending it in web forms. This is particularly useful for simple file upload implementations where the binary data needs to be transmitted as text.

### Considerations

- **Increased Size**: Base64-encoded data is roughly 33% larger than the original binary data. This increase in size can be a drawback, particularly for larger files or images.

- **Performance Impact**: Large Base64-encoded data can impact performance, both in terms of page load times and browser rendering, due to the increased size and the need for decoding.

- **Not for Large Files**: For large files or images, it's generally better to use traditional methods of file linking or serving, rather than embedding them as Base64.
