## ✅ How to fetch data using API?
You can think of an API as being like a restaurant waiter. You don't go inside the kitchen to prepare your meal when you dine at a restaurant. Rather, you inform the waiter of your preferences, and they will take 
your order to the kitchen team. The kitchen team prepares the food and returns it to the waiter, who then delivers it to your table.

An API functions as a waiter for software applications. It is a set of rules that lets one program ask another for something it needs. It serves as a bridge for software apps to communicate and interact.
**Different ways of fetching data:**
-Use the JavaScript Fetch() method
-Use the Axios Library
-Use the useFetch custom hook from react-fetch-hook
-Use the stale-while-revalidate (SWR) method
